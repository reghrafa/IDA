# Documentation on how to write Documentation

What do you want to document? Depending on the answer pick your subchapter. And allways use the [Basic Documentation Guidelines](#Basic-Documentation-Guidelines).

## Documentation of Code

The documentation of code has to be mostly in the `Filename.doc.md` File inside the component folder.[\*ref](./General#Form-Structure)\
Or if the documentation is not for one specific component you can just put it inside the same folder as the file you want to document. **But** it is **important** that you first check if there already is a \*.doc.md File that describes the peace of code you want to describe. Than you of cause just need to change it.

### Code Documentation Structure

If you write about one component you should first of all describe the purpose of the component. Ask yourself why does the component exist?\
Secondly you should prepare a small guide on how to use your component. What are the props and what do they do.\
At last write down exactly how you fulfilled the purpose of the component. Did you have problems? How did you fix them? Is there room for improvement? Are there problems that you didnt know how to fix and you maybe used a small hack to work around? If you feel like someone else might be abled to improve your component you should give them all the information they would need.\
Additionally if you used any external libraries you should specify them and supply a link to the corresponding github and or npm page.

## Documentation of Concepts

If you just want to document a concept that is needed to understand the way the app works, you can ether add a document inside the `/documentation` path or you add a new Chapter in one of the existing files if your topic fits the file`s theme.
